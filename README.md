# Drag & Drop Presets Demo

This repository hosts a minimal, framework-free demo that showcases drag and drop
interactions alongside simple preset styling. The project also includes
lightweight error handling so that common issues surface in the browser console.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Drag any of the colored notes into the canvas area.
3. Apply a preset to restyle the canvas.

If an issue occurs while dragging, dropping, or applying a preset, a concise
error message will appear in the browser console to help with debugging.
