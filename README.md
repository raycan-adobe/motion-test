# Motion Presets Demo

A small, framework-free playground that showcases a handful of motion presets with live previews. Each preset includes a miniature looping animation as well as a larger stage where you can trigger the motion on demand.

## Getting started

Simply open `index.html` in your favourite browser. No build steps or dependencies required.

## Features

- Five distinct entrance animations (fade, bounce, zoom, slide, tilt)
- Always-on mini previews next to every radio control
- Replay button to quickly re-trigger the currently selected animation

Feel free to extend the preset list or tweak the timing curves to suit your project.
