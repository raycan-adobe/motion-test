# Motion Preset Explorer

A tiny static demo that showcases a handful of animation presets. Each preset has
its own control for adjusting the animation duration and a live preview stage so
you can instantly see how the motion feels.

## Getting started

No build tooling is requiredâ€”simply open `index.html` in your browser to explore
the presets.
